## Requirements

### Node

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v20.10.0

    $ npm --version
    10.2.3

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g

---



## Running the project

    First install all the dependencies using
    $ npm i

    Then run the project using 
    $ node index.js

## Note

    I've used local MongoDB server as database, if you've not installed MongoDB on your system,
    please install the following from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
